I’m waiting for studies from model\\nproviders and API providers.\\n8\\nThe knowledge part is tricky, as the roleplaying model shouldn’t say things that Jackie Chan doesn’t\\nknow. For example, if Jackie Chan doesn’t speak Vietnamese, you should check that the roleplaying\\nmodel doesn’t speak Vietnamese. The “negative knowledge” check is very important for gaming. You\\ndon’t want an NPC to accidentally give players spoilers.\\n9\\nHowever, the electricity cost might be different, depending on the usage.\\n0\\nAnother argument for making training data public is that since models are likely trained on data\\nscraped from the internet, which was generated by the public, the public should have the right to\\naccess the models’ training data.\\n1\\nIn spirit, this restriction is similar to the Elastic License that forbids companies from offering the\\nopen source version of Elastic as a hosted service and competing with the Elasticsearch platform.\\n2\\nIt’s possible that a model’s output can’t be used to improve other models, even if its license allows\\nthat. Consider model X that is trained on ChatGPT’s outputs. X might have a license that allows this,\\nbut if ChatGPT doesn’t, then X violated ChatGPT’s terms of use, and therefore, X can’t be used. This\\nis why knowing a model’s data lineage is so important.\\n3\\nFor example, as of this writing, you can access GPT-4 models only via OpenAI or Azure. Some\\nmight argue that being able to provide services on top of OpenAI’s proprietary models is a key'},\n",

It starts with a discussion of the criteria\\nyou might use to evaluate your applications and how these criteria are\\ndefined and calculated. For example, many people worry about AI making\\nup facts—how is factual consistency detected? How are domain-specific\\ncapabilities like math, science, reasoning, and summarization measured?\\nThe second part focuses on model selection. Given an increasing number of\\nfoundation models to choose from, it can feel overwhelming to choose the\\nright model for your application. Thousands of benchmarks have been\\nintroduced to evaluate these models along different criteria. Can these\\nbenchmarks be trusted? How do you select what benchmarks to use? How\\nabout public leaderboards that aggregate multiple benchmarks?\\nThe model landscape is teeming with proprietary models and open source\\nmodels. A question many teams will need to visit over and over again is\\nwhether to host their own models or to use a model API. This question has\\nbecome more nuanced with the introduction of model API services built on\\ntop of open source models.</td>\n",

For these companies, the data privacy policy is more about\\nwhat services they can trust. They trust big cloud providers but don’t trust other startups.\\n5\\nThe story was reported by several outlets, including TechRadar (see “Samsung Workers Made a\\nMajor Error by Using ChatGPT”, by Lewis Maddison (April 2023).\\n6\\nAs regulations are evolving around the world, requirements for auditable information of models and\\ntraining data may increase. Commercial models may be able to provide certifications, saving\\ncompanies from the effort.\\n7\\nUsers want models to be open source because open means more information and more options, but\\nwhat’s in it for model developers? Many companies have sprung up to capitalize on open source\\nmodels by providing inference and finetuning services. It’s not a bad thing. Many people need these\\nservices to leverage open source models. But, from model developers’ perspective, why invest\\nmillions, if not billions, into building models just for others to make money?It might be argued that\\nMeta supports open source models only to keep their competitors (Google, Microsoft/OpenAI) in\\ncheck. Both Mistral and Cohere have open source models, but they also have APIs. At some point,\\ninference services on top of Mistral and Cohere models become their competitors.There’s the\\nargument that open source is better for society, and maybe that’s enough as an incentive. People who\\nwant what’s good for society will continue to push for open source, and maybe there will be enough\\ncollective goodwill to help open source prevail. I certainly hope so.\\n8\\nThe companies that get hit the most by API costs are probably not the biggest companies. The\\nbiggest companies might be important enough to service providers to negotiate favorable terms.\\n9\\nThis is similar to the philosophy in software infrastructure to always use the most popular tools that\\nhave been extensively tested by the community.</td>\n",

       "247  reason Microsoft invested in OpenAI.\\n4\\nInterestingly enough, some companies with strict data privacy requirements have told me that even\\nthough they can’t usually send data to third-party services, they’re okay with sending their data to\\nmodels hosted on GCP, AWS, and Azure. For these companies, the data privacy policy is more about\\nwhat services they can trust. They trust big cloud providers but don’t trust other startups.\\n5\\nThe story was reported by several outlets, including TechRadar (see “Samsung Workers Made a\\nMajor Error by Using ChatGPT”, by Lewis Maddison (April 2023).\\n6\\nAs regulations are evolving around the world, requirements for auditable information of models and\\ntraining data may increase. Commercial models may be able to provide certifications, saving\\ncompanies from the effort.\\n7\\nUsers want models to be open source because open means more information and more options, but\\nwhat’s in it for model developers? Many companies have sprung up to capitalize on open source\\nmodels by providing inference and finetuning services. It’s not a bad thing. Many people need these\\nservices to leverage open source models. But, from model developers’ perspective, why invest\\nmillions, if not billions, into building models just for others to make money?It might be argued that\\nMeta supports open source models only to keep their competitors (Google, Microsoft/OpenAI) in\\ncheck. Both Mistral and Cohere have open source models, but they also have APIs. At some point,\\ninference services on top of Mistral and Cohere models become their competitors.There’s the\\nargument that open source is better for society, and maybe that’s enough as an incentive. People who\\nwant what’s good for society will continue to push for open source, and maybe there will be enough\\ncollective goodwill to help open source prevail. I certainly hope so.\\n8\\nThe companies that get hit the most by API costs are probably not the biggest companies. The\\nbiggest companies might be important enough to service providers to negotiate favorable terms.\\n9\\nThis is similar to the philosophy in software infrastructure to always use the most popular tools that\\nhave been extensively tested by the community.  \n",
